- Beleive in your product! take your time to really see the genuine need for the product, its usefullness, how much value it brings... The man who sharpens his axes, will cut down the tree faster than the one that starts cutting eariler... the same goes in sales, really understanding your product will get you far ahead
- Same goes with understanding your customers, know thier needs, What risks keep them awake at night, What they get punished for, What costs them money, What regulations they must obey, and so on.
- Also having positive intent is essential.

- We want the customer to feel comftrable when making a buying decision, otherwise they will put thier guard up.
- #### Pay attention, not only to what the customer is saying, but what they are feeling, thier MOOD, body language
- #### Exaturate/encourage the bad feelings that can occur, when we think about unmet needs, then show the Benefits

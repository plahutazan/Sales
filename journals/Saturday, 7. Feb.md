i want to make a system for learning sales, i want to make like a giant study paper, like a giant book, studying every single small thing, like How to win friends and influence people book.

### how?

Use a daily journal to dump everything you learn about sales (ideas, mistakes, insights).
Every few days, move the best lessons into the right folders in your Sales_Mastermind system (psychology, persuasion, funnels, closing, etc.).

- this will be done by ai eventually

and study, document them, make sure to keep a nice strucutre dont just paste random quotes or lessons, focus on one thing and really go deep into it.
When you try things in real life, log results in the Labs folder.

Learn → journal → organize → test → repeat.
That’s it — your personal sales brain that compounds over years.

### All buyers have a very simmilar procces, and you can map the behavior of decision making in the SALES CYCLE
1. the realization of a need/problem
2. searching for information and opinions
3. evaluation of specific options against agreed criteria
4. check options
5. explore why not - plan b
6. purchase
7. post sales evaluation

Unless you are completly comfotrable at each stage, consumers will want to hold off

for no matter what you are selling you should know how they act at each stage, what they are saying, thinking, feeling, doing..

### Sales is a simple procces

1. Prepare: *(find as much as you possibly can about the person, thier needs you can meet)*
2. Connect: *(introduce, tuning in to the customer: voice, speech pattern, speed...)*
3. Discover: *(dig deep to uncover the customers unmet needs, generate rapport, find commonality)*
4. Match *(demonstrate how our product/service matches the unmet needs)*
5. Close

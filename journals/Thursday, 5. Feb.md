### The single most important sales question:
What is the most important thing to you about the service that we will prodive

what is the worst thing about what youre currently being provided with, why

What are your expectations exactly?
- write down everything, ask them to be more specific, then ask if you have everything

you need to get the client to be more and more interested in exactly what have you got to offer:
- can i ask you 3 questions:
  1. what is the most imporant thing to you about the service that you require, ask more follow up questions
  2. whats your expectations exactly?, ask more follow up questions
  3. Q3 is a hypothetical, "if i were able to do all those things that are imporant ^^, and meet your expecations ^^, would there be amything else we would need to consider"
*and if thry point you out for asking them like 7 questions, just be like sorry, i got excited*

### When they ask you something,
always ask, why do you ask?

what is the most pressing issue facing you in the business right now?

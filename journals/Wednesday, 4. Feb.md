Hi {{Name}},
We’ve been working with risk/compliance teams to map enforcement trends they weren’t seeing in traditional reporting.

If understanding where DOJ focus is moving matters to you, happy to share what we’re seeing on a quick call.

Hey {{Name}} —
We’re seeing repeat enforcement patterns across healthcare orgs that most compliance reviews miss.

Happy to share what we’re finding if you’re open to a short chat.

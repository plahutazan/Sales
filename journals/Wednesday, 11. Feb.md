i need to make a system to gamify sales in a way i stay up until 3am, cant stop thinking about it and it takes just 4 simple steps:

1. ## Clear goal
   - you will have a clear check point that will take around a week to a month (called "a mission"), but also 3 daily goals, that will get me closer to the main goal, the three goals go by priority:
     - 1. is a must to, to keep the schedule, but also is the hardest and will make the most progress
     - 2. is a should do, ussaly this goal if not completed will be the next day's main goal
     - 3. is a side mission, it can help or not, it should be more fun, to compell my self to complete the 1. asap
---
    Each mission should:

    ✔️ Be measurable
    ✔️ End with something created
    ✔️ Slightly hard but doable
    ✔️ Move real skill forward

        EXAMPLES:
            Mission 1: Become insane at attention
            - Write 300 hooks
            - Analyze 100 viral ads
            - Post 20 pieces of content

            Mission 2: Cold outreach mastery
            - Send 200 DMs/emails
            - Test 10 message versions
            - Track replies

2. ## Vissible progress
- goals completed, missions completed, progress made

1. ## Daily streaks
- once streak hits 10-20 days, you Wont be able to break it. The streak is completing the main daily goal

1. ## Rewards
- complete one big goal(a mission), you can buy yourself anything for 15$, or put towards a spearfishing trip or guilt free evening gaming shesh, or save towards a bigger buy, or for taxidermy, or dreams.
